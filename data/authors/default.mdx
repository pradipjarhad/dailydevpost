Hey, I’m **Pradip**. I build, break, fix, and write about what I learn along the way.

**DailyDevPost** is a record of my journey as a working Software Developer learning, breaking things, fixing them, and getting a little better each time.

I work mainly with React and modern web tools. I’ve spent years building real products, fixing bugs under pressure, rewriting code I once thought was “good enough,” and slowly understanding how things actually work. I’m not someone who learned everything early or had a clear path from the start. Most of what I know came from trying, failing, reading docs late at night, and doing the same thing again but better. 

DailyDevPost exists because I wanted a place to think out loud. When you learn in private, you forget quickly. When you learn in public, you think more clearly. Writing forces me to slow down, explain things in simple words, and question what I really understand versus what I’m just copying. I don’t write as an expert. I write as a working developer in the middle of the journey. Some days I’m confident. Some days I’m confused. Both show up here. 

Outside of code, I care about consistency, clear thinking, and building things that actually help people. I believe good developers are not the ones who know everything, but the ones who keep showing up and improving quietly. If my posts help you understand something, avoid a mistake, or feel less alone in this process, then this space is doing its job. 

I’ll keep writing. 
You keep building.
