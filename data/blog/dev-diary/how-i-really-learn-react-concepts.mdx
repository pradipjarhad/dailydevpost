# How I Really Learn React Concepts

When people write about learning React, it often sounds very clean.

They say things like:

- “Start with the basics”
- “Understand the core concepts first”
- “Build small projects”
- “Read the documentation carefully”

None of that is wrong.  
But that’s also not how learning actually happens for me.

My real learning process is messy, slow, confusing, and full of wrong turns. And most of the time, it doesn’t look like learning at all. It looks like work.

This post is not about the ideal way to learn React.  
It’s about how I actually learn it.

## I Don’t Sit Down to “Learn React”

This might sound strange, but I almost never sit down with the intention of learning React.

I sit down to:

- Fix a bug  
- Build a feature  
- Change existing behavior  
- Understand why something broke  

React learning happens as a side effect.

If I wait to “learn React properly” before doing real work, I never move forward. Real problems force learning in a way tutorials never do.

---

## I Learn React Through Confusion First

Most blog posts explain concepts as if understanding comes first and confusion comes later.

For me, it’s the opposite.

Confusion always comes first.

I see things like:

- A component re-rendering too often  
- State not updating the way I expect  
- An effect running when I didn’t want it to  
- Props behaving differently than I assumed  

At that moment, I don’t understand the concept. I only know that something feels wrong.

That discomfort is the starting point.

---

## I Make Wrong Assumptions (A Lot)

This is a big part of my learning process, even though it’s uncomfortable.

I assume things like:

- “This will only run once”  
- “This state won’t change here”  
- “React will remember this value”  
- “This component won’t re-render”  

Most of the time, at least one of those assumptions is wrong.

When React behaves differently than I expect, that gap between expectation and reality becomes the lesson.

Not because someone explained it well, but because the mistake cost me time.

---

## I Learn When Something Breaks, Not When It Works

When code works on the first try, I rarely learn much from it.

Real learning happens when:

- A small change breaks something unrelated  
- A fix creates a new bug  
- The UI behaves differently after a refactor  
- Performance suddenly drops  

Breakage forces attention.

I slow down.  
I read the code again.  
I trace what actually happens instead of what I *think* happens.

That’s when React concepts stop being abstract and start becoming real.

---

## I Read Code More Than I Write Code

Blogs often say “build projects” as if writing code is the main thing.

For me, reading code taught me more.

I read:

- My own old components  
- Code written by teammates  
- Code I don’t fully agree with  
- Code that works but feels confusing  

While reading, I ask simple questions:

- Why is this state here?  
- Why is this effect needed?  
- Why is this prop passed down?  
- What would break if I remove this?  

Understanding React often comes from seeing how decisions play out over time, not from examples written to teach.

---

## I Learn Concepts Backward

Most tutorials explain React concepts in a clean order.

My learning is backward.

I usually start with:

- A bug  
- A strange behavior  
- An unclear piece of code  

Only later do I go back and read:

- Documentation  
- Blog posts  
- Explanations  

At that point, the words mean something.  
Before that, they’re just text.

Reading documentation without a real problem feels like reading answers without knowing the question.

---

## I Learn by Removing Code

One of the biggest changes in how I learn React came when I started deleting code instead of adding more.

When something is confusing, my first instinct used to be:

- “Maybe I need another state”  
- “Maybe I need another effect”  

Now I ask:

- “What happens if I remove this?”

Removing code shows what is truly necessary.

React concepts become clearer when I see what *isn’t* needed.

---

## I Learn Slowly, and I Repeat the Same Lessons

This part doesn’t get talked about much.

I don’t learn React concepts once.

I learn them:

- Incorrectly  
- Then partially  
- Then correctly in one context  
- Then incorrectly again in another context  

The same idea comes back again and again.

Each time, my understanding gets a little better.

If I expect myself to “understand it fully” the first time, I get frustrated. Accepting repetition made learning calmer.

---

## I Use Console Logs More Than Explanations

This might sound basic, but it’s true.

I learn React by:

- Logging values  
- Logging render counts  
- Logging when effects run  
- Logging props and state changes  

Seeing real values at real times teaches me more than reading explanations.

The browser shows me the truth.  
My assumptions often don’t.

---

## I Learn React Through Side Effects of Decisions

Some of my best lessons came weeks after making a decision.

For example:

- Choosing one way to structure components  
- Handling state at a certain level  
- Passing data through props instead of context  

At first, everything seems fine.

Later:

- Code becomes harder to change  
- Bugs become harder to trace  
- Components become tightly coupled  

Those long-term consequences teach React concepts in a way no tutorial can.

---

## I Learn When I Have to Explain Something

Even though I don’t learn by teaching, explaining helps me notice gaps.

When I try to explain a React behavior in simple words and can’t, it means I don’t understand it yet.

Writing forces clarity.

That’s why I write about learning React while I’m still confused. Once it feels obvious, the learning moment is already gone.

---

## I Don’t Separate “Beginner” and “Advanced” Concepts

Blogs often label things as beginner or advanced.

In real work, those labels don’t matter.

A simple concept can cause deep bugs.  
An advanced concept might not matter at all in a project.

I learn React concepts based on:

- What problem they solve  
- What confusion they remove  
- What trade-offs they introduce  

Not based on their difficulty label.

---

## I Learn More From Mistakes Than From Success

This might sound obvious, but it took time to accept.

I used to feel bad about mistakes.  
Now I see them as part of the process.

Every time I misunderstand React:

- I learn how it doesn’t work  
- I remember the lesson longer  
- I become more careful next time  

Mistakes are expensive teachers, but they’re effective.

---

## I Don’t Rush to Memorize

I don’t try to remember every rule.

I focus on:

- Patterns I see often  
- Problems that repeat  
- Confusions that keep coming back  

Over time, memory builds naturally.

Trying to memorize React behavior without context never worked for me.

---

## I Learn React While Being Slightly Uncomfortable

If everything feels clear and easy, I’m probably not learning much.

Real learning usually feels like:

- “I think I understand, but I’m not sure”  
- “This works, but I don’t fully trust it yet”  
- “I need to revisit this later”  

That discomfort is a signal, not a problem.

---

## How This Is Different From Blog Advice

Most blogs show:

- Clean paths  
- Clear steps  
- Final understanding  

My real learning path looks like:

- Confusion  
- Wrong assumptions  
- Trial and error  
- Slow clarity  

Both have value. But only one reflects real work.

---

## Why I Accept This Way of Learning Now

Earlier, I felt guilty for not learning “properly”.

Now I understand something simple:

Learning React is not about following a perfect plan.  
It’s about staying with problems long enough to understand them.

This way of learning is slower, but it sticks.

---

## Final Thought

If I had to describe how I really learn React in one line, it would be this:

> **I don’t learn React by studying it.  
> I learn React by struggling with it and paying attention while I do.**

That struggle is not a failure.

It’s the process.
