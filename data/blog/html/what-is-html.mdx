If you’ve ever wondered how websites are made or what powers those pages you visit daily, the answer starts with something called **HTML**. Whether you’re a beginner looking to dive into web development or simply curious about the web’s foundation, understanding HTML is essential.

In this blog post, we’ll explore **what HTML is, why it’s important, and how it works** — all in simple terms that anyone can grasp. So, let’s get started!

## What Does HTML Stand For?

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. At its core, it is the **standard language used to create and design web pages**. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage — it provides the basic structure on which everything else, like styling and interactivity, is built.

- **HyperText** means the text contains links that you can click to jump to other pages or sections.
- **Markup Language** means it uses tags to define elements and how they appear or behave on the page.

## Why is HTML Important?

When you open your favorite website, what you see is a combination of various technologies working together. Among these, HTML is the foundation. Without HTML:

- Your browser wouldn’t know how to display text, images, or links.
- Web pages wouldn’t have any structure or meaningful content.
- The internet as we know it would not exist.

In simple terms, HTML tells your browser **what content to show and how to organize it**. It is the essential starting point for creating any website or web application.

## How Does HTML Work?

HTML uses a system of **tags** to define different parts of the webpage. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and more. Tags usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag, for example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
